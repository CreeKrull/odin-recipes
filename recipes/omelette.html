    <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>Omelette - it's what for breakfast. Or lunch. Or dinner. Or whenever.</p>
        <p>As with quiche, you're building atop a generic palette, but instead of crust-and-egg-mixture, it's just an egg mixture that you're heating to perfection in a skillet. Experiment with cheese, vegetables, herbs and even fruit on the vegetarian side, and the recipe that follows will be vegetarian. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/8 c light cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 T olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 white onion, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 c spinach, chopped</li>
            <li>4 oz feta, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 t honey</li>
            <li>2 t balsamic reduction</li>
        </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add 1 T olive oil to skillet and set on med-low heat</li>
                    <li>In a medium mixing bowl, mix the eggs, light cream, 1/2 t salt and as much pepper as you like.</li>
                    <li>In a small mixing bowl, mix the honey, balsamic reduction and remaining salt.</li>
                    <li>When the skillet is hot, pour in the egg mixture and cover the skillet with a lid.</li>
                    <li>After approximately 3-5 minutes, lift the lid and examine your egg mixture. You're looking for the eggs to be nearly cooked through. Once they've reached that state, add the onion, spinach and feta to one half of the omelette.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle the filling with your honey-balsamic mixture.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the heat and use a thin spatula - preferably two - to fold the omelette in half.</li>
                    <li>Re-place the lid on the skillet for 2-3 minutes, then remove and serve. Serves 1-2 persons and keeps well when refrigerated.</li>
