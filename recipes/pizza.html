    <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>Making quiche may feel intimidating, but it needn't be if you get your liquid ratios correct. In contrast to other quiches you may have had - light and souffle-like in texture - this recipe produces a reasonably dense body when fully cooked.</p>
        <p>As for ingredients, those fall into four categories: cheese, vegetables, herbs & spices, and if you desire, some type(s) of meat. For illustration purposes, the recipe below is vegetarian, and assumes you're using a frozen pie shell.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pie shell</li>
            <li>7 eggs</li>
            <li>7/8 c light cream</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 T olive oil</li>
            <li>1 white or yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>8-12 small mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>6 oz sun-dried tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>8 oz cheddar, grated</li>
            <li>1 T butter</li>
        </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
                    <li>In a medium mixing bowl, mix the eggs, light cream, salt and as much pepper as you like.</li>
                    <li>In a medium skillet, saute the onions until they start to brown. Add the mushrooms and continue sauteeing until they have expressed most of their liquid. Add sun-dried tomatoes, stir and remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Remove frozen pie shell from freezer and place on a baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Layer 1/3rd of cheddar, half of the sauteed vegetables and half of your egg-cream mixture. Repeat again, topping with your final 1/3rd of grated cheddar.</li>
                    <li>Dot the surface of the quiche with small amounts of butter (these will spread during baking and help to prevent a glossy finished surface).</li>
                    <li>Place the quiche on the middle rack in the oven.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 35-50 min; it's ready when the middle of the quiche is set and the quiche itself is starting to rise. </li>
                    <li>Cool on a rack. Serves 4-8. Eat immediately or refrigerate - it's good either way!</li>
