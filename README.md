Task list:
Overall: Build a basic website with links to a few recipes
- Use command line
- Display working knowledge of HTML
- Use Git to stage and commit files

Post-project reflection:
- Using the command line was super efficient for copying my first recipe, renaming the files, moving them, etc.
- Building the html pages was more difficult than I expected due to some syntax errors I was making (e.g., a=href instead of a href=...; capitalizing the first letter of omelette.html broke the link in my index.file)
- Git use took some time to become automatic, and I likely over-atomized my commits. At another point, I opened up some working links from another assignment in VSC while trying to puzzle one of the errors noted above and noticed some "...upstream missing" messaging in response to my git commands. What to do? I followed the instructions for re-establishing the pathway between my local and remote versions, and the messages returned from git commands went back to "normal." 
- Similar situation occured when I changed the name on one my recipe htmls. I got some practice using rm command and re-adding and -committing a file.
